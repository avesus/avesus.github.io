<h1>From Control to Teleportation</h1>

This website is about Computation. We will learn how computation emerges from low-level
geometry allowing control, and build a hierarchy of algorithms of more high-level control
and arithmetics, moving through numeric methods of mathematics, and running physical simulations
in an attempt to learn how to predict and control the reality around us.
