<h1>Scaffolding</h1>

Let's experiment with computation using the browser, and nothing else.
It's 2020, so we already can run almost low-level assembly instructions code in WebAssembly.
We have WebGL 1.0 consistently deployed in every device fully supporting GPU rendering API
called OpenGL ES 2.0.
And we have classes and destructuring in ES6, which is the best version of JavaScript web came up with.

Let's ignore cool kid's toolchains and frameworks, because these cause us more trouble than help
to explain concepts easily, and build everything literally from scratch.
