Let's experiment with computation using the browser, and nothing else.
It's 2020, so we already can run almost low-level assembly instructions code in WebAssembly.
</p>
<p>
We have WebGL 1.0 consistently deployed in every device fully supporting GPU rendering API
called OpenGL ES 2.0.
</p>
<p>
And we have classes and destructuring in ES6, which is the best version of JavaScript web came up with.
</p>

<p>
Let's ignore cool kids' toolchains and frameworks: these cause trouble impeding simple explanations
of concepts. We're going to build everything literally from scratch.

<p>
Let's explore the concept of control.</p>

<p>
Control is the smallest computation step, it's a basic building block of computation.

Control is a trivial operation. A basic building block of control is a switch, or a valve.

Another word for "control" is "regulation".

The mysterious combination of the controlled outcomes ("results", "outputs") is often called "computation".
