<section><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Although modern advancements in science have succeeded
in modeling the entire building of mathematics using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_constructions">Calulus of Constructions"</a>,
it's fascinating how far one can go in the process of

<p>The author of this article strongly believes that computation should be built
from the ground up, and we already succeed with this profoundly:
the entire world of computation we use today is based purely on
Multiplexer logic, which commonly known as <a>Register-Transfer-Level</a>.
</p>

<p>Let's explore how this kind of logic allows us to create the entire building
of modern mathematics and physics using level-triggered switching only.</p>

<p>At first, we have to agree on operational semantics,
deciding what is time, when things happen, how we order things.
An elementary multiplexer is a device which separates "past" from "future".

Addition is done using an XOR operation,
which requires to invert one of the inputs,
